Very early pre-alpha version of a Sports Management-style videogame myself and Evan Watson (Oregon State University) are slowly desigining

The codebase itself hasn't been tested for actually loading from the savefile (though the save file appears to work saving everything), but on an event-by-event basis it works
Note that it's only built for a game I designed. Modularity/multiple games will come much later.
